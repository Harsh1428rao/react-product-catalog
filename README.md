The **Product Catalog** is an interactive online platform displaying various products with features like search, filtering, and hover effects. Users can view detailed product information and explore categories in a responsive layout. The catalog offers a seamless browsing experience across devices.

### Instructions for Installing and Running the Application Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

#### **1. Clone the repository**
- First, clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
  ```
  Replace `yourusername` and `your-repository-name` with your GitHub username and the repository name.

#### **2. Install Dependencies**
- Navigate to the project folder:
  ```bash
  cd your-repository-name
  ```

- If you're using **npm**, install the required dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

  Or, if you're using **Yarn**:
  ```bash
  yarn install
  ```

#### **3. Run the Application**
- After installing the dependencies, you can run the development server:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

  Or, if you're using **Yarn**:
  ```bash
  yarn start
  ```

- The app should now be running locally. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by the terminal).

### Additional Libraries and Tools Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For routing within the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS styling.
- **React Icons**: For adding vector icons to the application.
- **React Hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect` for managing component states and side effects.
- **JSON Server** (optional): Used to mock an API for fetching products data, if applicable.

You can install any missing libraries by running:
```bash
npm install react-router-dom tailwindcss react-icons
```

### Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome

1. **Aligning Product Cards Horizontally:**
   - **Challenge**: Initially, the product cards were appearing vertically instead of horizontally.
   - **Solution**: I implemented a `flex` layout with `overflow-x-auto` and adjusted the card sizes. Tailwind CSS utilities such as `max-w-xs`, `hover:scale-105`, and `space-x-6` were used to create responsive horizontal cards with hover effects.

2. **Making Images Interactive on Hover:**
   - **Challenge**: I needed to ensure that when the user hovered over the image, it should scale and move forward, giving a 3D-like effect.
   - **Solution**: I used Tailwind's transition utilities (`transition-all`, `transform`, `hover:scale-110`) to achieve the hover effect.

3. **Routing for Product Details Page:**
   - **Challenge**: Proper routing was required for product details, which needed to dynamically display information based on the clicked product.
   - **Solution**: I used `react-router-dom` to create dynamic routes and pass product details through the route parameters.

### Optional Enhancements Implemented

1. **Search and Filter Functionality:**
   - Implemented a search bar to filter products by name.
   - Added a category filter so users can narrow down products by category.

2. **Hover Animations:**
   - Enhanced the product card UI with hover animations using Tailwind's `hover:scale-105` and `hover:shadow-2xl` to provide an interactive experience.

3. **Responsive Layout:**
   - Ensured the product list is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes by using Tailwindâ€™s grid and flex utilities (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4`).

4. **Cart Feature (Optional Enhancement):**
   - Added a cart feature to allow users to add products to their cart and view the total number of items in the cart.

### Screenshots of the Application

Unfortunately, I cannot provide screenshots directly, but you can capture the following screens on your local setup:

1. **Homepage with Product List:**
   - Show the main page where products are displayed in horizontal cards.
   - Capture the hover effect where the product image scales up when the user hovers over it.

2. **Product Details Page:**
   - Capture the product detail page after clicking on a product, showing detailed information like name, price, description, etc.

3. **Search and Filter:**
   - Show how the user can search for products or filter them by category.

4. **Cart Feature (if implemented):**
   - Capture the cart icon with a number indicating the number of items added to the cart.

By following these instructions, you should be able to run and enhance your project locally, while also having a robust user interface with interactive features.
